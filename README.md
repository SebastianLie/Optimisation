# Optimisation
 Contains optimisation algorithms written from scratch and some data analysis also using optimisation algorithms written from scratch.

Specifically, it contains code written for modules DSA3102 Convex Optimisation and DSA4212 High Dimensional Optimisation, and is 
sorted as such: convex is code from 3102, and high dimensional denotes code from 4212. This repo will also contain any 
other optimisation algorithms I write.

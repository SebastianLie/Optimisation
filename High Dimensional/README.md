# High Dimensional Optimisation

 Contains jupyter notebooks that serve some supervised learning objective using optimisation algorithms written from scratch. 
 Although I never received any feedback nor scoring for this work (the prof never delivered on his promise) 
 I did do rather decently for this module, leading me to believe code here was probably correct.
